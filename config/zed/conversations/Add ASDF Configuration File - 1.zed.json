ASDF (Another System Definition Facility) is commonly used in Common Lisp projects for system definitions.\n\nTo help you add an ASDF file, I'll need some information:\n\n1. What's the name of your project?\n2. What are the main components/files in your project?\n3. Are there any dependencies you need to declare?\n\nPlease provide these details, and I'll help you create an appropriate ASDF system definition file.\n\nA basic ASDF file structure looks like this:\n\n```lisp\n(asdf:defsystem :your-project-name\n  :version \"0.1.0\"\n  :author \"Your Name\"\n  :license \"Your License\"\n  :description \"Description of your project\"\n  :depends-on (:dependency1 :dependency2)\n  :components ((:file \"package\")\n               (:file \"main\" :depends-on (\"package\"))))\n```\n\nLet me know the specifics of your project, and I'll help you create a properly configured ASDF file.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":30}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":21},"start":33,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":31}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":22},"start":996,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":32}}}],"summary":"Add ASDF Configuration File","slash_command_output_sections":[]}
