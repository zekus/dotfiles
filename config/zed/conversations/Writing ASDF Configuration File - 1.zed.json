To use this:\n\n1. Make sure asdf is installed\n2. Install the plugins you need for each tool, e.g.:\n   ```bash\n   asdf plugin add nodejs\n   asdf plugin add ruby\n   # etc.\n   ```\n3. Place this file in your project root or home directory\n4. Run:\n   ```bash\n   asdf install\n   ```\n\nYou can modify the versions according to your needs. To see available versions for a tool:\n```bash\nasdf list all nodejs\n```\n\nTo install a specific version:\n```bash\nasdf install nodejs 18.16.0\n```\n\nTo set a global version:\n```bash\nasdf global nodejs 18.16.0\n```\n\nRemember to only include the tools you actually need in your project.\nadd the asdf file to the project\nI'll help you add the `.tool-versions` file (asdf configuration) to the project. I'll create a version that's appropriate for a JavaScript/Node.js project.\n\n```yaml\n# .tool-versions\nnodejs 20.11.0\npnpm 8.15.1\n```\n\nThis configuration:\n- Uses Node.js 20.11.0 (LTS version)\n- Includes pnpm 8.15.1 for package management\n\nTo use this:\n\n1. First, make sure you have asdf installed\n2. Install the required plugins:\n```bash\nasdf plugin add nodejs\nasdf plugin add pnpm\n```\n\n3. Then run:\n```bash\nasdf install\n```\n\nThe file has been added to your project. Would you like me to help you with anything else related to the asdf setup?\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":81}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":16},"start":23,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":82}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":17},"start":1150,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":83}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":68},"start":1183,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":84}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":69},"start":1805,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":85}}}],"summary":"Writing ASDF Configuration File","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
